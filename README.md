Large Language Model (LLM) Project
Overview
This repository contains code for a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of machine learning model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and language translation.

Features
Pre-trained models: Includes pre-trained models such as GPT-2, BERT, and TransformerXL.
Fine-tuning: Code for fine-tuning pre-trained models on custom datasets for specific tasks.
Text generation: Example code for generating text using pre-trained models based on user prompts.
Deployment: Instructions and code for deploying LLMs as web services or integrating them into other applications.
